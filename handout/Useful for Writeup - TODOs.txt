TODO - Mike

Fix dijkstra using the nodes in Nodes.txt file.
Make GraphInfo data structure, which stores a hashmap of node names to its neighbors.
Make a GraphEntry class that is correspondent of a two-element array, storing the sequence number and the neighbor array.
Then, create a LSA Message that will be driven as the following - 
"Name Seq# ["NeighborA.to_s(), "NeighborB.to_s()", ..., "NeighborZ.to_s()"

Send and receive LSA messages and update Dijkstra accordingly.

Then create a new Neighbor that takes in a string and replaces the current graph info key to value map pairing with one that parses the string and sets the costs to the message that was given.

Fix the edgeb, edgeu and edge d to be dealt acordingly

Figure out how to accept multiple neighbors if still an issue after doing all the above. 

Make public tests.
